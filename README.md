# HPC Lab

This repository contains code for the lab of the course [IN4049] *Introduction to High Performance Computing* of TU Delft.

The `Makefile` in the current directory is used to automate connection and file transfer to the server.
e.g., to connect to the server, simply type `make conn`.

Note that `sshpass` is required for embedding the password into `Makefile`.
