# IN4049_HPC_Lab

This repository contains code for the lab of the course [IN4049] Introduction to High Performance Computing of TU Delft.

Some settings such as file transfer and connection to server are made for Windows 10 with "Bash on Ubuntu on Windows" enabled.

The `Makefile` in the current directory is used to automate connection to the server.
To connect to the server, simply type `make conn` in Bash on Ubuntu on Windows.
Note that `sshpass` is required for this feature.
