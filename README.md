# HPC Lab

This repository contains code for the lab of the course [IN4049] *Introduction to High Performance Computing* of TU Delft.

Some settings such as *file transfer* and *auto-connection to server* are made for Windows 10 with *Bash on Ubuntu on Windows* enabled.

The `Makefile` in the current directory is used to automate connection to the server.
To connect to the server, simply type `make conn` after putting the `Makefile` into *Bash on Ubuntu on Windows*.
(e.g. one possible way is to clone the repository using `git`.)

Note that `sshpass` is required for auto connection.
