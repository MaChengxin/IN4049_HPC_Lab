The folder `html` contains documentation for `SEQ_Poisson.c`.

The documentation is genearted using `Doxygen`, following the instructions on [this website](https://romanegloo.wordpress.com/2012/03/29/generating-a-callgraph-by-using-doxygen-and-graphviz-13/).

The `Makefile` is changed accordingly. (optional)
